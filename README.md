# autoresponder-magnum

I want to build an autoresponder platform similar to Wasapbot. The platform should have the following features:

1. **Automated Notifications**: Send order notifications, reminders, and updates to customers automatically.
2. **Chatbot Integration**: Integrate with AI to provide automated responses to customer inquiries.
3. **Bulk Messaging**: Allow sending bulk messages to customers for marketing campaigns.
4. **Label Management**: Automatically manage and sync labels in WhatsApp Business to organize contacts and messages.
5. **Anti-Ban Features**: Include features to prevent the WhatsApp number from being banned.
6. **Auto-reply to WhatsApp or WA Business**: Automatically respond to messages on WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business.
7. **Individually Customizable**: Allow users to customize responses individually.
8. **Auto Reply with Media**: Enable auto-replies that include media files.
9. **Auto Reply with Voice Message**: Enable auto-replies that include voice messages.
10. **Send Replies to Specific Messages**: Allow sending specific replies to particular messages.
11. **Welcome Message for New Chats**: Send a welcome message to new chats.
12. **Live Answer Replacements**: Include dynamic replacements like time and name in responses.
13. **Multiple Replies in One Rule**: Allow multiple replies to be set within a single rule.
14. **Works with Contacts, Groups, and Unknown Numbers**: Ensure compatibility with contacts, groups, and unknown numbers.
15. **Ignore and Specify Contacts and Groups**: Allow users to ignore or specify certain contacts and groups.
16. **Automatic Scheduler with Delay**: Include a scheduler to send messages with a delay.
17. **AI Integration**: Integrate with AI services like ChatGPT/GPT-3/GPT-4 or Dialogflow.com for advanced responses.
18. **Auto Follow-up**: Automatically follow up with prospects who don't reply after a specific time.
19. **Backup Rules**: Provide a feature to backup rules for easy recovery.

Please generate the necessary code and workflows to implement these features. Ensure the platform is user-friendly and scalable.
